This project uses data from bwght2.dta, which contains linked files of birth and infant death
certificates with National Center for Health Statistics birth rate and mortality data.

The one - and five- minute APGAR scores are measures of the well-being of infants just after
birth. An interesting feature of the score is that it is bounded between zero and 10, making a
linear model less than ideal. Still, a linear model would be informative.

Your task for this project is to discover the determinants of child health using birthweight or
one of the APGAR scores as the outcome variable. Do NOT explain one with the other! You can
analyze either outcome, either as a continuous variable, or as a binary outcome (low
birthweight, or low APGAR score). There are a number of interesting covariates you can
explore, on their own and as interactions, such as the number of prenatal visits, smoking and
alcohol consumption (during pregnancy).

A useful paper to provide background, both for interpretation and as suggestions for empirical
specification, is:
