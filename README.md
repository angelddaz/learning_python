# learning_python
Books, tutorials, personal projects, homework, etc. a place where I struggle with Python

I consider this a place where it's ok to make mistakes and really get to the joy of 
following through on curiosity. These scripts all started with a desire to learn something.

As of 20170331, I hope to add more learning experiences from the books I want to go through.

Specifically;
  Data Science From Scratch, Joel Grus;
  Think Stats, Allen B. Downey;
  Data Wrangling with Python, Jacqueline Kazil & Katharine Jarmul;

As I have no immediate business need for either Python or R right now, I want to focus on Python.
